Bullet Physics Block Toy is a 3D simulation program that demonstrates physics interactions in real time. The program allows you to spawn objects such as spheres, boxes, and other geometric shapes, then watch them fall under gravity and collide with the floor and each other.

As objects fall, the simulation calculates impulses and contacts, enabling visual feedback for collisions. This makes it ideal for experimenting with physics behaviors like bouncing, stacking, and sliding of objects in a controlled 3D environment.
